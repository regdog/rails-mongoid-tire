# Meet the Rubber App
Rubber is a sample Rails 3.2 app with [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org) and Tire (http://github.com/karmi/tire) for full-text search via the incredibly powerful (and incredibly cool) [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org).

Right now, Rubber is really just a WIP as I write the accompanying tutorial. Stay tuned.
